# Simple Landing Pages

## Description
Those are simple landing pages I've bulit during my learning process. Their purpose was to train new gained skills that I will use in the future, more advanced projects. They might not look fancy, but to me they are a solid base that allowed me to jump into more advanced coding.

You will find two files there: 

1. AnaloguePhotographyLandingPage - Page about analouge photography 

Very simple page, using HTML, CSS and Vanilla JS. It helped me getting familliar with the HTML tags and styling them. It was also the first time I used JavaScript. The most difficult part to me was definitely to make the button work.

2. VegetarianismLandingPageWithDarkTheme - Page about vegetarianism 

A little bit more adcanced page. It's main purpose was to learn how to make a dark theme, but I also made a button similar to one in previous site  in order to memorise this knowleadge better. I struggled the most with the toggle option, but thanks to the research I've done, I know I could also do it like this: ```body.classlist.toggle("dark")```. The more you know!

## Used technologies

In both sites I used CSS, HTML and Vanilla JavaScript.
